# Open Oversight Plugin

This plugin was created by a request from Alan Kessler to make a tool that would ease
the upload of images to Open Oversight. It adds a context menu to all `<img>` elements on
a page that will automatically send a request to Open Oversight for the specified police
department.

It is offered via the GNU Public License v3 in accordance with Open Oversight's licensing.
